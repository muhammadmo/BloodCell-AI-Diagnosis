# BloodCell-AI-Diagnosis
This repository contains the official implementation of the paper 
"AI-Based Diagnostic Tool for Blood Cell Recognition".

The project provides a complete pipeline for automated blood cell analysis, including:
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Deep learning–based feature extraction
- Classification models for various blood cell types
- Evaluation metrics and visualization tools
- Scripts for training, testing, and dataset preparation

The goal of this work is to support medical diagnostics by enabling fast, accurate, and reproducible recognition of blood cell categories using AI-driven methods.
